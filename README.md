# Stacks & Queues

**About:** In this project, the goal is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes, a scripting language that relies on a unique stack with specific instructions for manipulation. Monty 0.98 is compiled into Monty byte codes, and these bytecode files typically have a .m extension. The interpreter reads these files, executes the bytecode commands, and manipulates a stack based on LIFO (Last In, First Out) and FIFO (First In, First Out) principles. The project involves using doubly linked lists to represent the stack and queue structures, with specific functions handling different opcodes.

## How to compile

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty`
